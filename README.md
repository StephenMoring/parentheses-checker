# parentheses-checker
Verifies parentheses in LISP code are properly closed

After pulling the repo run 'npm install'

Run 'npm start' in your terminal to have the program run the deafult test file I have in /sample_input

You may also add your own .txt to /sample_input and run 'npm start example.txt' to run your own tests

If you would like to run the Jest test suite, just run 'npm test'

Thanks!
